# CS Technical Test

Console project to showcase the requirements of the technical test.
This project will use the Factory, Strategy/RuleEngine and Depedency Injecton patterns to solve the techinical test specifications.

The project was built upon .NET 5 Framework to try and be most compatible and buildable as possible, as the version was not specified.

The solution built for the SQL part is present in the main folder as two scripts:

1 - SCRIPT_CREATE_MAIN.sql (Create and initialize databases).
2 - RUN SCRIPT.sql ( Sample run query to show case the solution).
